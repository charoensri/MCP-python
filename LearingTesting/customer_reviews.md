**Summary of Frequency**

- **Frequently** – Issues that appear in multiple reviews and dominate the negative sentiment: poor quality, breakage, misleading description, and performance shortfalls.  
- **Occasionally** – Issues that are mentioned but not as prevalent: limited features, design flaws, shipping delays, packaging damage, and customer support complaints.  
- **Rare** – Problems that only appear in a handful of reviews: refund refusal, packaging mistakes, and a few isolated cases of color‑option dissatisfaction.
